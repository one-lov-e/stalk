                        <p> 
                    <br>So what is the difference
                    between gaming headphones and gaming headsets?

                    <br>Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic Gaming headphones
                    are regular headphones that are used traditionally for music enjoyment. However, they possess qualities that are awesome
                    for gaming needs too. Audiophilic characteristics such as great micro-detail retrieval, accurate sound stage and
                    immersive sound experience make them feasible to double up as a pair of gaming headphones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <br>However, most audiophile
                    headphones do not come with a mic nor do they have any mic attachment slots. You will need to get an external mic like
                    the Blue Yeti X for communication support. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <br>A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja, famous for
                    streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser
                    Microphone while streaming his games. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <br>There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming headphones setup for
                    gaming. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <br>Benefits of Gaming Headphones Higher upsides for audio and mic quality 
                        </p>
                    <p>As you have a wider product selection for
                    both the headphones and mic itself, you are able to assemble your gaming setup with the latest mic and headphones. There
                    is potential for better overall audio and microphone quality.
