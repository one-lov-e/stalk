        <p>
            <br> The very first step in this
            checklist is to decide if you want a pair of gaming headphones or a pair of gaming headsets.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>So what is the difference
            between gaming headphones and gaming headsets?
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic Gaming headphones
            are regular headphones that are used traditionally for music enjoyment. However, they possess qualities that
            are awesome
            for gaming needs too. Audiophilic characteristics such as great micro-detail retrieval, accurate sound stage
            and
            immersive sound experience make them feasible to double up as a pair of gaming headphones.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>However, most audiophile
            headphones do not come with a mic nor do they have any mic attachment slots. You will need to get an
            external mic like
            the Blue Yeti X for communication support.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja, famous for
            streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid
            Condenser
            Microphone while streaming his games.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming headphones setup for
            gaming.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>Benefits of Gaming Headphones Higher upsides for audio and mic quality
        </p>
        <p>As you have a wider product selection for
            both the headphones and mic itself, you are able to assemble your gaming setup with the latest mic and
            headphones. There
            is potential for better overall audio and microphone quality.
